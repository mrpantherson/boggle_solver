# boogle_solver

This is an ancient program I wrote back in 2004, it uses a breadth first search to solve a boogle game.  I've thought about updating (weird coding conventions I used to use / reinventing the wheel) it or converting it to python but I haven't had the time.  I put it up here in case it might be useful to somebody looking for a similar solution to that problem.
